# StudentTestPortal

 As part of a varsity assignment. I created a Windows application that allows lectures to create a test consisting of multiple choice questions, which the students can then answer on this application.

The lecture is logging in which will bring up the lecture form

When the mouse has clicked edit users, change test or results, the program will bring up the respected pages

Dummy data is inputted into for the purpose of this demonstration. Data has been placed into the create student form.

Once the create button has been pressed, the application will notify the user that the user has been added to the database

![Lecturer Saved Student](ReadMeImages/Lecturer%20Saved%20Student.jpg)

Once the user has confirmed to delete the selected user, the application will notify the user that the deletion was successful.

When the user clicks on change test on the main menu, the application will present the user with this page, allowing them to have multiple actions, create, change and delete.

When the user selects a new test, they will be presented with the Test page, allowing the user to add questions to a new Test. The dummy data is entered to show the result of creating a test.

If the user selects the Results from the main menu, they will see this page, allowing them to view each student mark as well as the highest, lowest and average mark for the test to evaluate its difficulty.

The test data is used to log in, thus having no test marks since itâ€™s a new account.  The application will know if the user has written a test or not, the button will change if the student has written the test before, for testing purposes, the new user will write a test. After writing the test, the program will know if the user has done it and will show the corresponding mark that they got as well as change the buttons function to review test when a done test has been selected.

Once the user selects a test, in this case, it was the first test in the list. The user will not be able to click finish before the test has been complete.
